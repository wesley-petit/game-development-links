# How to configure GIT for Game Development ?

## Introduction
GIT was made for source code versioning and not large binary files handling. Even with [GIT LFS support](https://git-lfs.com/), 
it's often lead to a tricky merge between two files that are not human friendly.

But game development mainly consists of large binary files (models, scenes...), so why use it?

Because it's generally one of the first versioning method learned by a programmer, so there is no need to learn, install and configure another versioning software.
And, in my case, I often found GIT skills requirements in job offers.
