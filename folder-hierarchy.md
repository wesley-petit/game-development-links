# Folder hierarchy
## Description
It's a folder hierarchy that I generally follow for intermediate project (1-3 months), because it's scale very well.  
In opposite to asset type hierarchy, we gather all assets in components folder. For instance, a character named "Mario" will have  
a folder in Arts that will contain 3D Models, animations, materials and textures concerning Mario.

Following such hierarchy allows to easily :
- add and remove a feature from the project.
- found any assets concerning a character or an object.

It's also sort by job type, so each person can concentrate on his own branch :
- Arts => Modeling
- Cores => Programming
- Placeables => Level design
