# Game Development Links
## About The Project
I often share game development links and tutorials with my colleagues. So I decided to create one repository containing all these informations to avoid repeating.

⚠️ Some parts are personal choices that I choose to follow. It's typically the case with coding standard.

## Usage
- [Unreal Engine useful links](unreal-engine-useful-links.md)
- [Unity Engine useful links](unity-engine-useful-links.md)
- [GIT for game development](git-for-game-development.md)
- [Project Structure](project-structure.md)
